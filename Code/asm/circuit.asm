main_loop:
    ; Read the operator and two operands from the user
    ; You may need to implement input/output functions specific to your circuit board

    ; Check if the user wants to exit (e.g., by pressing a specific button)
    ; If yes, jump to exit_label

    ; Perform the operation based on the operator input
    ; You'll need to implement code for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

    ; Display the result to the user
    ; You may need to implement output functions specific to your circuit board

    ; Jump back to main_loop to allow for continuous calculations

exit_label:
    ; Exit the program, if needed

    ; Additional code for cleanup or other tasks, if needed

    ; End the program
